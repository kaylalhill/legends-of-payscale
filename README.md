LEGENDS OF PAYSCALE - README
============================

*A simple game featuring PayScale, Inc. coworkers as characters.

*An experiment in using time module/sleep function, creating definitions, and using the input function.

*In a future version I may attempt nested loops again in order to create more possible outcomes per scenario (as well as a few dead ends).


Version 1.0 Notes
-----------------
*Created using Pythonxy 2.7 - Not the best, I know.
*Should run fine in Python 3 if you strip the "raw_" from the raw_input().
